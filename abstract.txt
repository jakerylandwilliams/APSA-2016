Title: Meta-purpose, design, and analysis of socially-driven systems

Abstract:

The growth and adoption of computation by societies 
have led to notable changes in how people communicate and mobilize.
While information sharing and event reporting between individuals
is facilitated with intention in the design of these systems,
concurrent advances in theory, tools, and techniques for analysis
make it possible to automatically cull information from aggregate data.

However, these socio-technical systems are often not designed, or,
are ill-designed to suit meta-purposes for a variety of reasons
(e.g., precedent, historical incapability, bottom lines, privacy, etc.).

In this presentation, I will discuss my past and present research,
and then go into detail on two communities on which I am currently focused
(Wikimedia and Twitter). I will discuss how

(1) Wikimedia has produced the basis for a phrase-based (idiomatic)
    machine translation system, and

(2) Twitter's geo-spatial messaging has created a medium for the construction
    of a live system for monitoring social action.

While demonstrating the methods I have developed to accomplish these goals,
I will also discuss how each meta-system's limitations
are ultimately defined by design choices made by curators.
Time permitting, I will also discuss some preliminary findings
in my ongoing development of methods for phrase-based text analysis.

The growth and adoption of computation by societies 
have led to notable changes in how people communicate and mobilize.
Advances in theory, tools, and techniques for analysis 
make it possible to automatically cull information from aggregate data 
from socio-technical information sharing systems. These systems, however, 
are often not designed with larger purposes, such as these analyses, in mind.

I will discuss the methods I have developed to accomplish the goals of 

(1) creating a phrase-based (idiomatic) machine translation system 
    (using Wikipedia as a medium), and 

(2) constructing a live system for observing social action 
    (made possible by Twitter's geo-spatial messaging system).

Time permitting, I will also discuss some preliminary findings
in my ongoing development of methods for phrase-based text analysis.

The growth and adoption of computation by societies 
have led to notable changes in how people communicate and mobilize.
Advances in theory, tools, and techniques for analysis 
make it possible to automatically cull information through aggregate data 
from socio-technical information sharing systems, such as social media outlets. 
These systems, however, are often not designed with larger purposes, 
such as these analyses, in mind. I will discuss 
  1. my ongoing development of machine learning tools  
     to enhance information processing from unstructured text, 
  2. ways that I have applied these tools in collaboration 
     with others for societal good, and 
  3. larger upcoming projects to 
       (a) create a phrase-based (idiomatic) machine translation system 
           (using the Wiktionary as a basis), and 
       (b) construct a system for real time social action and events monitoring
           (using Twitter's geo-spatial messaging system).
